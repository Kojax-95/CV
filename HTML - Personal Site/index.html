  <h1>Tyler Ambrose</h1>
  <p><em>Entry level Full Stack Web Developer and Object Oriented Python Programmer</em></p>
  <hr>

  <h3>Education</h3>
  <p>I attended three years at <a href="https://www.dccc.edu/"><strong>Delaware Community College</strong></a> where I completed my generals and am currently a math
    class away from graduating with an associates degree.</p>
  <p>I transfered to <a href="https://drexel.edu/"><strong>Drexel University</strong></a> in the Fall of 2016. I attended for half a year before realizing it was
    financially unsustainable and lost interest in my major. I wanted to try and figure out what I exactly wanted to do with my career and skillset.</p>
  <p>I have also learned a lot of my programming and Web development skills through self practice as well as buying courses that
    I believe would further my education.</p>
